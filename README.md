# Random Number Generator
JavaScript function to generate random number based on current timestamp

This function first gets the current timestamp as a string using the ` Date.now() ` method. It then generates a random number between `0` and `1` using the `Math.random()` method, converts it to a string using the `toString()` method, and then takes the 2nd to 8th characters of the string using the `slice()` method. Finally, it combines the timestamp and random number to create the ID.

Note that the `Math.random()` method generates a random number between `0` and `1`, but it's not truly random and may have patterns over time. If you need more security, you may consider using a library like crypto to generate a more secure random number.
